/**
 * Wraps [delegate] and rejects non-routable addresses on the exact lookup OkHttp uses to open
 * the connection. A separate, earlier pre-check (e.g. [PrivateNetworkGuard.isAllowed] called
 * before issuing a request) cannot close a DNS-rebinding gap by itself, because it resolves the
 * host independently of — and before — the resolution the connection actually uses; an attacker
 * controlling authoritative DNS with a short TTL can answer the two lookups differently. Making
 * the guard part of the Dns implementation that OkHttp actually connects with means there is only
 * ever one resolution in the loop, closing that gap.
